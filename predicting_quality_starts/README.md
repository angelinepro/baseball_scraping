This folder has supplemental code for the blog post on predicting quality starts. To go through the analysis in order, refer to the [webscraping repo](https://github.com/angelinepro/portfolio_supplemental/tree/master/webscraping) for code to scrape Fangraphs and Baseball Reference, and then each of the cleaning notebooks ([Cleaning Baseball Reference data](https://github.com/angelinepro/portfolio_supplemental/blob/master/predicting_quality_starts/bbref_datacleaning.ipynb) and [cleaning Fangraphs data](https://github.com/angelinepro/portfolio_supplemental/blob/master/predicting_quality_starts/fangraphs_datacleaning.ipynb)) before [combining the Fangraphs and Baseball Reference data](https://github.com/angelinepro/portfolio_supplemental/blob/master/predicting_quality_starts/fangraphs_bbref_combine.ipynb) to finally [explore the data and model quality starts](https://github.com/angelinepro/portfolio_supplemental/blob/master/predicting_quality_starts/modeling.ipynb).
